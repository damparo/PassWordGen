# PassWordGen
The assignment was about using javascript to create a password generator.  
HTML/CSS was provided so the main focus was setting up JS to allow the page 
to interact with the user and have it generate a password.
I created a roadmap on paper outlining the steps that are needed to get the 
password. I was able to create the prompts and generate if/else statements but I had
a hard time putting together a working function to assemble a password.
My next step is to rework my functions to generate a password.
