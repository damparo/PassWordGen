# PassWordGen

## Project Goal

The goal of this assignment was to create a password generator that satisfied certain conditions for length, usage of lower/upper case characters, and special characters.


## Functionality

The generator was built using javascript for functionality, and html/css for the website.  If statements were used to create alerts that allows the user to select the conditions then the generator can be ran.
